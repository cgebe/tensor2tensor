DGX-1 (P100)

- Joint 5 translation task | MultiModel: 190 seconds per 100 steps => 5 days 12 hours
- Joint 3 across translation, summarization and labeling | MultiModel: 130 seconds per 100 steps => 3 days 18 hours
- Single translation task | Transformer: 75 seconds per 100 steps => 2 days 6 hours
- Single translation task | MultiModel: 90 seconds per 100 steps => 2 days 15 hours

TODO:
- chapter 2 and chapter 3

After publication / think about everything
- Thesis Corpora Availability to mediatum, check upload possibilities
- Publication of paper about multi task deep learning in the legal domain
- Papers: 7 each single / joint / joint all
- or 1 Paper: containing everything
- Multimodel add to tenor2tensor

FIXES:
Reasearch Milestones:
- Analysis of Multi-Task Models
- Formulate in more general ways, no library names
